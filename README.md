# Explorer

This is a project i've undertaken to help myself learn C# and SQL server.

It is an explorer/survival game that takes in a completely separate universe from our own. The player will have to collect, name and observe elements of the game world
as they attempt to survive by their wits. None of our laws of physics may apply, or may apply in different and unique ways. The player must test and observe to unlock
things like element interaction, animal/plant behavior and so on. 

I will be attempting a graphical interface through the Godot game engine since it supports C# scripting natively.

Please send me an email or message with any feedback
